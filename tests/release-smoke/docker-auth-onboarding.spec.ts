/**
 * Open the wizard on its first step and hand back the organization-name field.
 *
 * `/onboarding` resolves to `{ initialStep: 1 }` on a self-hosted instance
 * (`resolveRouteOnboardingOptions`) and the route keeps the wizard open, so
 * this lands on "name your organization" whether or not the instance already
 * holds a company. Navigating explicitly is what keeps the spec re-runnable:
 * the release-smoke config retries once in CI, and by the second attempt the
 * instance is no longer company-less, so sign-in lands on a dashboard instead.
 *
 * The saved draft is dropped first. Sign-in on an instance that already holds
 * an agentless company redirects into *that* company's onboarding, which
 * persists its id into the draft; the restored draft then makes step 1 skip
 * creating a company and hire into the old one instead. That is an artifact of
 * re-running against a re-used instance, not behaviour this spec is asserting,
 * and a fresh release-smoke container never has it.
 *
 * The field is located by role. Step 1 has no id and its `<label>` is not
 * associated with the input, so the alternative is its placeholder copy — the
 * exact coupling that let this spec drift. The wizard's first screen has
 * exactly one text box, and a second one appearing there would fail Playwright's
 * strict mode loudly rather than silently matching the wrong control.
