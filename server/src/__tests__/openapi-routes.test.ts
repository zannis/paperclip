 * For now the hand scan stays: its rules are individually pinned by tests and

 *   200 return, so this is the one direction in which it could over-report; every
 *   entry it reports is confirmed against its handler before being added.
 * - **`try` stays transparent.** A `catch` that swallowed the assertion's `HttpError`
 *   and answered anyway would defeat it. None does — the error handlers here
 *   propagate `HttpError.status` — and eleven guarded routes assert inside a `try`,
 *   so treating `try` as opaque would blind the guard to all of them.
