 * Regression fixture for the adverse report on PAP-17207: two exclusive isolated workspaces
 * asked for the same configured app/HMR pair at the same moment. One lane came up healthy,
 * the loser was reallocated onto a port owned by an unrelated listener, and its managed start
 * never reached a terminal state — leaving an active operation that rejected managed cleanup.
 *
 * The two mechanisms that produced the non-terminality are covered here:
 *   1. a readiness probe against a socket that accepts but never answers, and
 *   2. concurrent allocation handing the same port to two starts.
