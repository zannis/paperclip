/**
 * Startup validation for the runtime API URL handed to spawned agent runs.
 *
 * `PAPERCLIP_API_URL` is exported into every run so an agent can call its own
 * board. An operator override is deliberately authoritative, because a derived
 * public origin is often unreachable from inside a runtime container. Nothing
 * checked that the override actually answers the board API, though: point it at
 * a UI origin or an auth proxy and every board call gets HTML back. A
 * deterministic `process` agent surfaces that as an anonymous non-zero exit,
 * one agent at a time, hours after the misconfiguration landed.
 *
 * So probe the resolved URL once, at boot, as soon as the listener is up, and
 * fall back to an origin that does answer. The probe is a routing check, not a
 * health check: a Paperclip-shaped health response means the board API is on
 * the other end, including a `503 unhealthy` one.
 *
 * A spawned run attaches its bearer run token to whatever origin wins, so the
 * two candidates are not interchangeable and the check is deliberately narrow:
 *
 * - The **configured** URL is the operator's own explicit choice, and it is
 *   what every run already inherited before this check existed. The probe can
 *   only ever reject it, never widen where credentials go, so the board health
 *   shape is signal enough to keep it.
 * - The **fallback** is chosen by this server, so promoting it is the only way
 *   this check could send a run somewhere new. No response body can prove the
 *   responder is this server: every self-identifying value the health route
 *   publishes (`commit`, `serverVersion`) is readable off that same route by
 *   anything that can reach it, so any process able to answer the probe can
 *   also echo whatever the probe wants to see. The single fallback is therefore
 *   authenticated by construction rather than by content — it is built from the
 *   address this process actually bound (see {@link runtimeSelfOriginApiUrl}),
 *   an origin no other process can be holding. There is no second fallback,
 *   because there is no second origin that can be proven to be us.
 *
 * Dropping the wider candidate list from this decision costs nothing a run can
 * use: runtime clients still walk `PAPERCLIP_RUNTIME_API_CANDIDATES_JSON` at
 * request time. What changes is that no unauthenticated response can promote
 * one of those origins to the credential-bearing default.
