 * Each capability maps to a list of requirement groups. A group holds one or

 *
 * The verbs are the worker method names from the worker discovery list (the
 * plugin worker reports them from `handleInitialize`). A built-in provider maps
 * its own methods to the same verb names through
 * {@link builtinSandboxProviderVerifiedMethods}, so both branches share this
 * mapping and the one normalizer below.
 *
 * The mapping was audited against the worker discovery list and the runtime
 * execution guards:
 * - `nativeSyncIn`/`nativeSyncOut` require the matching sync verb; the native
 *   sync guard checks both verbs before it routes a lease to the native hook.
 * - `reusableLeases` requires `environmentResumeLease` (reattach),
 *   `environmentReleaseLease` (end-of-run release), and `environmentDestroyLease`
 *   (stale-lease teardown). All three run on the reuse path: the runtime resumes
 *   or releases the lease, and it destroys the stale lease when a resume fails
 *   before it acquires a fresh lease.
 * - `persistentProcessSessions` and `independentControlCommands` require
 *   `environmentExecute`; both run commands through it.
 * - `incrementalSessionOutput` requires `environmentExecute` too, because the
 *   provider tails the session log through it. The verified verb is necessary
 *   but not sufficient: this key is opt-in, so the declaration is the real gate
 *   (see {@link SANDBOX_CAPABILITY_OPT_IN_KEYS}).
 * - `concurrentSyncOperations` requires BOTH sync verbs, because parallel
 *   bidirectional transfer runs an inbound and an outbound transfer at the same
 *   time. The two verbs are separate required groups, so a provider that
 *   verifies only one direction cannot get the capability. The verbs are
 *   necessary but not sufficient: this key is opt-in, so the declaration is the
 *   real gate (see {@link SANDBOX_CAPABILITY_OPT_IN_KEYS}).
 * - `duplexCommandStream` requires `duplexChannelOpen`, the worker verb that
 *   opens the persistent duplex channel. The verified verb is necessary but not
 *   sufficient: this key is opt-in, so the declaration is the real gate. A
 *   provider that does not implement the duplex open verb resolves `false` and
