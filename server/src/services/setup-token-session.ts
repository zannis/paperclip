// The Claude setup-token login session service. It owns a company-scoped,
// owner-bound login session that holds one live setup-token process and one
// sandbox lease for the whole login. The login is a two-way round-trip: the
// `claude setup-token` process holds the flow state in memory, so the server
// keeps one live process and the lease alive inside one long-lived server
// process. The service never re-spawns the command per request and never splits
// the round-trip across separate runs.
//
// The service gives the harness these operations against the one live session:
// start the session, read the login prompt, submit one browser code, cancel the
// session, expire the session on a timeout, and receive the token. Every
// operation verifies the company, the owner user, and the adapter. A missing
// session and a cross-scope session both return the same not-found error.
//
// Security controls folded here:
//   * SR-1 (no secret in a log): the service keeps the full login URL, the
//     browser code, and the token out of every log, activity detail, error, and
//     telemetry sink. It surfaces the full URL only through the authorized owner
//     read response, and it exposes a sanitized URL form to every other reader.
//   * SR-3 (owner binding, atomic one-code): an opaque random session id, an
//     immutable scope, and a single compare-and-set transition from
//     `awaiting_code` to `submitting`. The service rejects every later submit.
//   * SR-4 (durable cleanup and caps): a non-secret cleanup record, an external
//     lease expiry no later than the session deadline, idempotent cleanup on
//     every terminal path, a startup reaper, per-owner/agent/company caps, and a
//     start rate limit.
//   * SR-5 (two login-URL representations): the full URL is transport-only; every
//     sink receives the sanitized URL form.
//   * SR-6 and SR-7 (fail-closed TLS transport guard): a centralized guard that
//     the route applies to the confidential read-prompt and receive-token
//     responses. The guard is a pure function in this module so it stays unit
//     testable.
