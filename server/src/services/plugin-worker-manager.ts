/**
 * PluginWorkerManager — spawns and manages out-of-process plugin worker child
 * processes, routes JSON-RPC 2.0 calls over stdio, and handles lifecycle
 * management including crash recovery with exponential backoff.
 *
 * Each installed plugin gets one dedicated worker process. The host sends
 * JSON-RPC requests over the child's stdin and reads responses from stdout.
 * Worker stderr is captured and forwarded to the host logger.
 *
 * Process Model (from PLUGIN_SPEC.md §12):
 * - One worker process per installed plugin
 * - Failure isolation: plugin crashes do not affect the host
 * - Graceful shutdown: 10-second drain, then SIGTERM, then SIGKILL
 * - Automatic restart with exponential backoff on unexpected exits
 *
 * @see PLUGIN_SPEC.md §12 — Process Model
 * @see PLUGIN_SPEC.md §12.5 — Graceful Shutdown Policy
 * @see PLUGIN_SPEC.md §13 — Host-Worker Protocol
