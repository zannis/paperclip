# restore-smoke.sh — restore backup artifacts into a throwaway environment and
# assert the result is usable. This is the repeatable test behind
# docs/deploy/backup-restore.md: run it on a schedule, because an artifact
# nobody has restored is a guess.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/restore-smoke.sh --db db-<ts>.sql.gz [--volume paperclip-<ts>.tar.gz]
#                            [--boot <paperclip image>]
#
# Options:
#   --db <file>          gzipped pg_dump artifact (required)
#   --volume <file>      gzipped tar of the data directory; enables the
#                        master-key and run-log checks, which are the two
#                        things a database-only restore loses silently
#   --image <ref>        postgres image, default postgres:17-alpine — match the
#                        major version the dump came from
#   --max-missing <n>    run-log refs allowed to be missing, default 0. Set it
#                        to the number the *source* deployment is known to
#                        lack (see restore-verify-logs.sh), never to whatever
#                        makes the check pass
#   --boot <ref>         after the artifact checks, start this Paperclip server
#                        image against the restored database and the extracted
#                        tree and require its health endpoint to report ok.
#                        Needs --volume. The clone runs on a Docker network
#                        with no route out, so its heartbeats, routines and
#                        connectors can reach nothing but the throwaway
#                        database. It then mints a throwaway agent API key
#                        in the restored database (never the source's), signs
#                        in with it, and requires the API to serve the
#                        company's agents and issues, one issue's comments,
#                        one finalized run's record and events, and its log,
#                        each matching the restored database — restore step
#                        6, done by the server rather than by hand
#   --max-torn <n>       unfinalized transcripts allowed to end mid-line,
#                        default 0. Same rule as --max-missing: the source's
#                        known count, measured with restore-verify-logs.sh
#                        against the live tree
#   --allow-unbound      the data-directory tar carries no .backup-generation
#                        marker (its producer does not write one), so nothing
#                        ties it to --db and in-flight transcripts cannot be
#                        bounded; accept that, and say so. Without it the
#                        marker must be the tar's first member and name the
#                        sha256 of --db
#   --boot-timeout <s>   seconds to wait for the booted server, default 300;
#                        migrations newer than the dump apply during this
#   --keep               leave the containers, network and extracted tree
#                        behind
#
# Needs docker and tar on the host, and node when --volume is given (it
# decrypts the restored secrets with the restored key); psql runs inside the
