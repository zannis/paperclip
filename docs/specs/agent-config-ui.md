# Agent Configuration & Activity UI

## Current implementation (2026-09-07)

The shipped new-agent flow starts from **Agents → New Agent**. A small dialog collects a name and an enabled adapter, then opens a setup page with numbered navigation. Claude and Codex have a subscription/API-key connection step. Configuration provides a searchable, free-text model selector and an environment selector; additional settings remain on the full agent page. **Finish setup** submits the existing governed hire request. Confirmation links to configuration and opens a new task with the created agent assigned; agents awaiting approval cannot be assigned work yet.

Paperclip Runner offers native Codex (app server), Claude via ACPX, and OpenCode. The selected provider is passed through the existing runner configuration builder. Codex's default is the adapter catalog default. OpenCode and Pi require a provider/model ID; OpenRouter uses `openrouter/<provider>/<model>` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Entered keys are tested through the probe-only `testCredentials` field without storage. Finishing setup saves each key as an isolated user secret so a failed test cannot overwrite another agent’s credential, and an existing organization secret can also be bound. Agent configuration and revisions contain references, never the entered key.

**Run test** uses the chosen environment and current configuration. For Claude/Codex readiness checks that do not make a model request, setup also invokes the adapter's existing CLI hello probe with the same environment and credentials. Runtime failures, provider failures, warnings, and in-progress tests use the same compact result card in setup and full configuration. Warnings remain distinguishable from blocking failures.

The new-agent dialog also retains an external-agent invitation link, with an optional message, one-time onboarding prompt, and clipboard fallback. External agents still require organization-admin approval.

The full configuration page retains the contextual navigation and existing instruction-file editor, skills, tools, permissions, API keys, and revision behavior. **Secrets & variables** groups environment bindings with API secret-access grants. Its page-level Save/Discard actions include editor-local environment drafts. Activity, runs, costs, and budgets link to the company audit views scoped to the agent.

The sections below are the original design reference; the implementation summary above supersedes their creation-dialog layout.

## Context

Agents are the employees of a Paperclip company. Each agent has an adapter type (`claude_local`, `codex_local`, `process`, `http`) that determines how it runs, a position in the org chart (who it reports to), a heartbeat policy (how/when it wakes up), and a budget. The UI at `/agents` needs to support creating and configuring agents, viewing their org hierarchy, and inspecting what they've been doing -- their run history, live logs, and accumulated costs.

This spec covers three surfaces:

1. **Agent Creation Dialog** -- the "New Agent" flow
2. **Agent Detail Page** -- configuration, activity, and logs
3. **Agents List Page** -- improvements to the existing list

---

## 1. Agent Creation Dialog

Follows the existing `NewIssueDialog` / `NewProjectDialog` pattern: a `Dialog` component with expand/minimize toggle, company badge breadcrumb, and Cmd+Enter submit.

### Fields

**Identity (always visible):**

| Field | Control | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| Name | Text input (large, auto-focused) | Yes | -- | e.g. "Alice", "Build Bot" |
| Title | Text input (subtitle style) | No | -- | e.g. "VP of Engineering" |
| Role | Chip popover (select) | No | `general` | Values from `AGENT_ROLES`: ceo, cto, cmo, cfo, engineer, designer, pm, qa, devops, researcher, general |
| Reports To | Chip popover (agent select) | No | -- | Dropdown of existing agents in the company. If this is the first agent, auto-set role to `ceo` and gray out Reports To. Otherwise required unless role is `ceo`. |
| Capabilities | Text input | No | -- | Free-text description of what this agent can do |

**Adapter (collapsible section, default open):**

| Field | Control | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| Adapter Type | Chip popover (select) | `claude_local` | `claude_local`, `codex_local`, `process`, `http` |
| Test environment | Button | -- | Runs adapter-specific diagnostics and returns pass/warn/fail checks for current unsaved config |
| CWD | Text input | -- | Working directory for local adapters |
| Prompt Template | Textarea | -- | Supports `{{ agent.id }}`, `{{ agent.name }}` etc. |
| Model | Text input | -- | Optional model override |

**Adapter-specific fields (shown/hidden based on adapter type):**

*claude_local:*
| Field | Control | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Max Turns Per Run | Number input | 80 |
| Skip Permissions | Toggle | true |

*codex_local:*
| Field | Control | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Search | Toggle | false |
| Bypass Sandbox | Toggle | true |

*process:*
| Field | Control | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Command | Text input | -- |
| Args | Text input (comma-separated) | -- |

*http:*
| Field | Control | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| URL | Text input | -- |
| Method | Select | POST |
| Headers | Key-value pairs | -- |

**Runtime (collapsible section, default collapsed):**

| Field | Control | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Context Mode | Chip popover | `thin` |
| Monthly Budget (cents) | Number input | 0 |
| Timeout (sec) | Number input | 900 |
| Grace Period (sec) | Number input | 15 |
| Extra Args | Text input | -- |
| Env Vars | Key-value pair editor | -- |

**Heartbeat Policy (collapsible section, default collapsed):**

| Field | Control | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Enabled | Toggle | true |
| Interval (sec) | Number input | 300 |
| Wake on Assignment | Toggle | true |
| Wake on On-Demand | Toggle | true |
| Wake on Automation | Toggle | true |
| Cooldown (sec) | Number input | 10 |

### Behavior

- On submit, calls `agentsApi.create(companyId, data)` where `data` packs identity fields at the top level and adapter-specific fields into `adapterConfig` and heartbeat/runtime into `runtimeConfig`.
- After creation, navigate to the new agent's detail page.
- If the company has zero agents, pre-fill role as `ceo` and disable Reports To.
- The adapter config section updates its visible fields when adapter type changes, preserving any shared field values (cwd, promptTemplate, etc.).

---

## 2. Agent Detail Page

Restructure the existing tabbed layout. Keep the header (name, role, title, status badge, action buttons) and add richer tabs.

### Header

```
[StatusBadge]  Agent Name                    [Invoke] [Pause/Resume] [...]
               Role / Title
```

The `[...]` overflow menu contains: Terminate, Reset Session, Create API Key.

### Tabs

#### Overview Tab

Two-column layout: left column is a summary card, right column is the org position.

**Summary card:**
- Adapter type + model (if set)
- Heartbeat interval (e.g. "every 5 min") or "Disabled"
- Last heartbeat time (relative, e.g. "3 min ago")
- Session status: "Active (session abc123...)" or "No session"
- Current month spend / budget with progress bar

**Org position card:**
- Reports to: clickable agent name (links to their detail page)
- Direct reports: list of agents who report to this agent (clickable)

#### Configuration Tab

Editable form with the same sections as the creation dialog (Adapter, Runtime, Heartbeat Policy) but pre-populated with current values. Uses inline editing -- click a value to edit, press Enter or blur to save via `agentsApi.update()`.

Sections:
- **Identity**: name, title, role, reports to, capabilities
- **Adapter Config**: all adapter-specific fields for the current adapter type
- **Heartbeat Policy**: enable/disable, interval, wake-on triggers, cooldown
- **Runtime**: context mode, budget, timeout, grace, env vars, extra args

Each section is a collapsible card. Save happens per-field (PATCH on blur/enter), not a single form submit. Validation errors show inline.

#### Runs Tab

This is the primary activity/history view. Shows a paginated list of heartbeat runs, most recent first.

**Run list item:**
```
[StatusIcon] #run-id-short   source: timer     2 min ago     1.2k tokens   $0.03
             "Reviewed 3 PRs and filed 2 issues"
```

Fields per row:
- Status icon (green check = succeeded, red X = failed, yellow spinner = running, gray clock = queued, orange timeout = timed_out, slash = cancelled)
- Run ID (short, first 8 chars)
- Invocation source chip (timer, assignment, on_demand, automation)
- Relative timestamp
- Token usage summary (total input + output)
- Cost
- Result summary (first line of result or error)

**Clicking a run** opens a run detail inline (accordion expand) or a slide-over panel showing:

- Full status timeline (queued -> running -> outcome) with timestamps
- Session before/after
- Token breakdown: input, output, cached input
- Cost breakdown
- Error message and error code (if failed)
- Exit code and signal (if applicable)

**Log viewer** within the run detail:
- Streams `heartbeat_run_events` for the run, ordered by `seq`
- Each event rendered as a log line with timestamp, level (color-coded), and message
- Events of type `stdout`/`stderr` shown in monospace
- System events shown with distinct styling
- For running runs, auto-scrolls and appends live via WebSocket events (`heartbeat.run.event`, `heartbeat.run.log`)
- "View full log" link fetches from `heartbeatsApi.log(runId)` and shows in a scrollable monospace container
- Truncation: show last 200 events by default, "Load more" button to fetch earlier events

#### Issues Tab

Keep as-is: list of issues assigned to this agent with status, clickable to navigate to issue detail.

#### Costs Tab

Expand the existing costs tab:

- **Cumulative totals** from `agent_runtime_state`: total input tokens, total output tokens, total cached tokens, total cost
- **Monthly budget** progress bar (current month spend vs budget)
- **Per-run cost table**: date, run ID, tokens in/out/cached, cost -- sortable by date or cost
- **Chart** (stretch): simple bar chart of daily spend over last 30 days

### Properties Panel (Right Sidebar)

The existing `AgentProperties` panel continues to show the quick-glance info. Add:
- Session ID (truncated, with copy button)
- Last error (if any, in red)
- Link to "View Configuration" (scrolls to / switches to Configuration tab)

---

## 3. Agents List Page

### Current state

Shows a flat list of agents with status badge, name, role, title, and budget bar.

### Improvements

**Add "New Agent" button** in the header (Plus icon + "New Agent"), opens the creation dialog.

**Add view toggle**: List view (current) and Org Chart view.

**Org Chart view:**
- Tree layout showing reporting hierarchy
- Each node shows: agent name, role, status badge
- CEO at the top, direct reports below, etc.
- Uses the `agentsApi.org(companyId)` endpoint which already returns `OrgNode[]`
- Clicking a node navigates to agent detail

**List view improvements:**
- Add adapter type as a small chip/tag on each row
- Add "last active" relative timestamp
- Add running indicator (animated dot) if agent currently has a running heartbeat

**Filtering:**
- Tab filters: All, Active, Paused, Error (similar to Issues page pattern)

## 4. Component Inventory

New components needed:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `NewAgentDialog` | Agent creation form dialog |
| `AgentConfigForm` | Shared form sections for create + edit (adapter, heartbeat, runtime) |
| `AdapterConfigFields` | Conditional fields based on adapter type |

Reused existing components:
- `StatusBadge`, `EntityRow`, `EmptyState`, `PropertyRow`
- shadcn: `Dialog`, `Tabs`, `Button`, `Popover`, `Command`, `Separator`, `Toggle`

---

## 5. API Surface

All endpoints already exist. No new server work needed for V1.

| Action | Endpoint | Used by |
|--------|----------|---------|
| List agents | `GET /companies/:id/agents` | List page |
| Get org tree | `GET /companies/:id/org` | Org chart view |
| Create agent | `POST /companies/:id/agents` | Creation dialog |
| Update agent | `PATCH /agents/:id` | Configuration tab |
| Pause/Resume/Terminate | `POST /agents/:id/{action}` | Header actions |
| Reset session | `POST /agents/:id/runtime-state/reset-session` | Overflow menu |
| Create API key | `POST /agents/:id/keys` | Overflow menu |
| Get runtime state | `GET /agents/:id/runtime-state` | Overview tab, properties panel |
| Invoke/Wakeup | `POST /agents/:id/heartbeat/invoke` | Header invoke button |
| List runs | `GET /companies/:id/heartbeat-runs?agentId=X` | Runs tab |
| Cancel run | `POST /heartbeat-runs/:id/cancel` | Run detail |
| Run events | `GET /heartbeat-runs/:id/events` | Log viewer |
| Run log | `GET /heartbeat-runs/:id/log` | Full log view |

## 6. Implementation Order

1. **New Agent Dialog** -- unblocks agent creation from the UI
2. **Agents List improvements** -- add New Agent button, tab filters, adapter chip, running indicator
3. **Agent Detail: Configuration tab** -- editable adapter/heartbeat/runtime config
4. **Agent Detail: Runs tab** -- run history list with status, tokens, cost
5. **Agent Detail: Run Detail + Log Viewer** -- expandable run detail with streaming logs
6. **Agent Detail: Overview tab** -- summary card, org position
7. **Agent Detail: Costs tab** -- expanded cost breakdown
8. **Org Chart view** -- tree visualization on list page
9. **Properties panel updates** -- session ID, last error

Steps 1-5 are the core. Steps 6-9 are polish.

Native ACPX connection tests reject unsupported local platforms before a host CLI
login can incorrectly mark the runner connected. The existing verified Claude
ACPX runtime requires Linux x64; remote environments are evaluated independently
of the control-plane host platform.
