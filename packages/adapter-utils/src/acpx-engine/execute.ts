/**
 * Content signature of a referenced-project host tree for the session fingerprint.
 *
 * The staged-runtime cache reuses an already-staged referenced-project tree on a
 * compatible resume and does not re-sync it. Referenced-project metadata (id, host
 * path, workspace id, repo url, pinned ref) can stay identical while the files at
 * that host path change: a branch moved to a new commit, a re-checkout in place, or
 * a dirty worktree. So the metadata identity alone lets a resume serve a stale tree.
 * This signature folds the tree's own content state into the identity.
 *
 * The walk reads each file's relative path and bytes and folds them into the hash.
 * It reads bytes, not only file stats. A stat-only signature (size and modification
 * time) collides when an edit keeps the byte length and the modification time — a
 * re-checkout that restores the same size and timestamp. The byte hash busts on any
 * content change, so the fingerprint busts and the next launch stages the current
 * tree. The walk skips the heavy build, cache, and git directories the staging path
 * never ships, plus the project's own resolved Git-ignored paths, and records a
 * symlink by its target text without following it. On a read error the function
 * returns a stable marker, so the fingerprint does not churn while staging
 * surfaces the real error. The walk runs only when the run carries referenced
 * projects (the multi-project sync path).
 *
 * `ignoreResolution` is the ONE resolution `resolveReferencedSourceIgnore`
 * computed for this project — the same one the sandbox lane and the SSH lane
 * consume. A `failed` resolution skips the walk entirely and returns a stable
 * marker instead, because a failed project is not staged and its bytes are not
 * read anywhere.

  //     `sessionParams` starts a new ACP session via `session/new`, so it must
  //     NOT inherit the prior session's staged home/credentials — it stages
  //     fresh even when company/agent/task/fingerprint (and hence sessionKey)
  //     collide.
  //   * Per-key staging lock: the stage-or-reuse decision runs under a

  //     ship into the same remote workspace at once (the loser waits, then
