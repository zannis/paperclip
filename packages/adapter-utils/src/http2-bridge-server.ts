/**
 * Host HTTP/2 server for the sandbox callback bridge transport.
 *
 * The server wraps one {@link CommandManagedDuplexChannel} as a Node `Duplex`
 * and runs one plaintext HTTP/2 session on it. It maps every stream on that
 * session to one call of the caller-supplied `forwardRequest` handler, then
 * writes the result back as the stream response. The handler applies the real
 * host token and the run attribution, so those rules stay in one place, next
 * to the existing file-bridge and duplex-bridge forward path.
 *
 * This file does not select the transport for a run. It builds and tests the
 * host half of the pair in isolation; a later phase wires the pair into the
 * transport-selection path.
 *
 * Requests flow from the sandbox to the host only: the host never opens a
 * stream to the sandbox. The server enforces three checks, in this order, for
 * every stream:
 *   1. a constant-time compare of the bridge token against the per-run token
 *      (accepted security fix 4), before any other processing;
 *   2. one canonical parse of the `:path` pseudo-header (accepted security fix
 *      3), whose result feeds both the route allowlist and the forward URL;
 *   3. the route allowlist and the header allowlist, reused unchanged from
 *      `sandbox-callback-bridge.ts`.
 * The server also bounds ten `http2.createServer` options (accepted security
 * fix 1), so Node enforces the session, header, and stream-reset limits on
 * every connection with no new component.
