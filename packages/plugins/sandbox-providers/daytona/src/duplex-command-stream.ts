// The Daytona duplex command stream for the sandbox callback bridge. The bridge
// needs one live bidirectional byte stream: the host writes request frames to the
// process, and the process writes response frames back, on one connection while
// the command runs. This module binds a Daytona pseudo-terminal (PTY) to a small
// session that the duplex transport consumes, so the gateway runs on a real
// terminal, streams its output, and receives host input.
//
// Primitive choice (the first acceptance criterion of the phase): the Daytona SDK
// proves two primitives. The ordinary session primitive (`createSession` plus
// `executeSessionCommand` plus `getSessionCommandLogs`) dispatches a command and
// tails its output, split into separate stdout and stderr streams. It exposes no
// call that writes bytes to a running command's stdin. The PTY primitive
// (`createPty`) exposes `sendInput` for host-to-process bytes and one `onData`
// callback for process-to-host bytes, on one live socket. Only the PTY carries a
// bidirectional stream on one connection, so this module uses the PTY. The
// characterization test in `duplex-command-stream.test.ts` records the evidence.
//
// Clean stream: a PTY echoes its input and translates newlines by default
// (`ICRNL` on input, `ONLCR` on output). The frames are newline-delimited JSON, so
// echo and newline translation corrupt the stream. The launch wrapper runs
// `stty raw -echo` before it starts the gateway, so the terminal becomes an 8-bit
// transparent path with no echo and no newline translation. The wrapper also
// redirects the gateway diagnostics to a file, so a diagnostic line never reaches
// the stdout frame stream. The wrapper starts the gateway with `exec`, so the PTY
// runs the gateway directly and the gateway exit code becomes the PTY exit code.
//
// Dependency boundary: this provider plugin ships standalone (the workspace
// excludes `packages/plugins/sandbox-providers/**`). So the module imports no
// workspace package. It reuses the narrow Daytona PTY surface that
// `login-pty.ts` declares (`DaytonaPtyProcess`, `DaytonaPtyHandle`,
// `DaytonaPtyCreateOptions`), so a caller passes `sandbox.process` with no
// adapter. The narrow surface keeps the module unit-testable with a fake PTY.
