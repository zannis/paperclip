/**
 * Operator-configurable settings visibility.
 *
 * A hosting operator (a managed cloud, an internal shared server) can hide
 * settings surfaces that do not apply to their deployment by setting the
 * `PAPERCLIP_HIDDEN_SETTINGS` environment variable to a comma-separated
 * list of keys from this registry. An experimental wildcard with named
 * exceptions can also hide future controls automatically. Hiding a surface removes it from the UI
 * (nav, routes, page sections). Surfaces backed by instance-level mutation
 * routes are also floored with a 403 carrying
 * `SETTINGS_OPERATOR_MANAGED_ERROR_CODE`: the Access, Plugins, and Adapters
 * pages, every field-backed General section, every experimental toggle
 * (individually or via the whole Experimental page), and the company Import
 * page (whose whole route surface is floored). The other company pages are
 * UI-visibility keys only: their APIs (memberships, invites, secrets,
 * exports) stay live for agents and integrations.
 *
 * Nothing is hidden by default: with the variable unset, UI and API behave
 * exactly as before this mechanism existed.
 *
 * Unknown keys are ignored (with a server-side warning) rather than rejected,
 * so an operator may roll one list across a fleet of mixed app versions: an
 * image that predates a key simply keeps that surface visible instead of
 * refusing to boot.
