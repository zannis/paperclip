# Capability Semantic Tool Catalog

The semantic tool catalog is the transport-neutral surface an agent may call. It
is a frozen set of JSON-schema descriptors — no HTTP method, path, or provider
detail. Provider-specific shapes are produced only by *bindings*, so every
provider sees the same operation set.

Each protocol action is single-sourced in its own module under
`src/protocol-actions/`. That module owns the action's policy metadata,
documentation, examples, and its live and scenario JSON-schema presentations.
`src/catalog/canonical-operations.ts`, `src/semantic-tools/catalog.ts`, and
`src/tools/capability-semantic-tool-catalog.ts` are compatibility projections;
do not add action definitions to them. See
[catalog reconciliation](../spec/capability/catalog-reconciliation.md).

Sources: `src/protocol-actions/`, `src/catalog/canonical-operations.ts`,
`src/tools/capability-semantic-tool-catalog.ts`,
`src/tools/capability-semantic-tool-types.ts`, `src/tools/capability-tool-bindings.ts`,
barrel `src/tools/index.ts`.

## Two dispositions, plus a separate control-plane list

A tool descriptor's `disposition` is either **`always_agent_tool`** or
**`optional_agent_tool`**. Control-plane-owned operations are a separate frozen
list, not a disposition — they are never exposed as tools. See
[capability disposition](capability-disposition.md) and
[authorization and exposure](capability-authorization-and-exposure.md).

The catalog holds **39 tools**: 14 always-agent tools and 25 optional tools
across 10 groups.

<!-- These counts are drift-checked against src/tools/capability-semantic-tool-catalog.ts
by src/catalog/catalog-docs.test.ts; update the catalog, not the numbers. -->

### Always-agent tools (14)

`get_task_context`, `get_task_history`, `list_documents`, `read_document`,
`list_document_revisions`, `report_progress`, `answer_status_question`,
`finish_task`, `block_task`, `request_review`, `write_document`,
`request_human_input`, `register_deliverable`, `inspect_operation_result`.

### Optional tools (25), by group

| Group | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| discovery | `search_tasks`, `list_agents`, `list_projects`, `list_goals` |
| delegation_dependencies | `create_task`, `reassign_task`, `set_dependencies` |
| governance | `list_approvals`, `request_approval`, `decide_approval`, `comment_on_approval` |
| cases | `list_cases`, `upsert_case` |
| workspace_runtime | `get_workspace_runtime`, `control_workspace_service` |
| routines | `list_routines`, `manage_routine` |
| company_skills | `create_skill`, `list_company_skills`, `sync_company_skills` |
| secrets | `list_secret_metadata`, `read_secret_value` |
| portability_admin | `export_company`, `administer_company` |
| test_escape_hatch | `generic_api_request` |

## Descriptor shape

Each descriptor carries `operationId`, `version` (1), `title`, `description`,
input/output JSON schemas, `disposition`, an optional `optionalGroup`,
`requiredClaims`, and optionally `allowedRoles`, `taskModes`, a `sideEffectClass`
(`read`, `task_write`, `company_write`, `governance`, `workspace_control`,
`secret_read`, `admin`, `test_escape_hatch`), an `idempotency` level, `redaction`
rules, and an abstract `mockCommandMapping`.

The `mockCommandMapping` is one of `context_read`, `snapshot_read`,
`semantic_command`, `operation_result`, or `mock_extension` — describing *what*
the tool does against the mock, never *how* a transport would carry it.

## Transport neutrality

Bindings, not descriptors, produce provider shapes, both derived from the same
`visibleTools.tools` array:

- `CapabilityFakeAgentToolBinding` emits `{operationId, description, inputSchema,
  outputSchema}`.
- `CapabilityCodexToolBinding` emits `{type: "function", name, description, strict:
  true, parameters}`.

Because both bindings derive from one array, the fake-agent and Codex operation
surfaces are byte-identical. The [conformance suite](capability-eval-conformance.md)
asserts this parity (the 18/18 fake-agent/Codex operation matrix).

## Running the tests

```sh
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner exec vitest run \
  src/tools/capability-semantic-tools.test.ts
```

The "catalog" describe asserts a unique, versioned, provider-neutral catalog and
that every optional group is present.

## Reassigning existing tasks

`reassign_task` moves another existing company task to an eligible agent. Read
`search_tasks` first and send the observed `expectedAssigneeActorId` (nullable)
and `expectedStatusVersion`, the new `assigneeActorId`, a handoff `reason`, and a
stable `idempotencyKey`. It requires `delegation:tasks:assign` and production
`tasks:assign` authorization in standard mode. The same task retains its
documents, dependencies, scope, priority, and history.

The old execution and any live goal must stop before ownership changes. Active
work returns to todo; backlog and blocked work retain their status and are not
started. An audited reassignment stop does not create a recovery blocker or
retry the outgoing run when it ends without a semantic completion result.
Assignment changes advance the observed version, including ordinary
API changes, to reject stale handoffs. A durable audit receipt makes retries
idempotent across caller runs; retrying after failed dispatch repairs the wake
with a stable key and an owner/status/version guard.

The current caller task, conversations, human-assigned tasks, completed or
cancelled tasks, and pending reviews cannot be reassigned with this tool. Use
`create_task` to delegate new work from the current task. A stop failure or
concurrent ownership change fails without applying the handoff.
