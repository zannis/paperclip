# Paperclip Native Runner

This package is the standalone development boundary for Paperclip's native
runner protocol, process supervision, durable transport, provider drivers, and
normalized session backends. Rust owns the production runner under `runner/`;
TypeScript provides the control-plane reference, browser SDK, scenario tools,
and conformance oracle.

The package includes one coherent set of capabilities: PRP v1 validation and
replay, a supervised local runner with a scripted fake harness, durable
WebSocket delivery and recovery, qualified Codex, OpenCode, ACPX, Claude
Managed, and AWS AgentCore drivers, live
session and issue-thread surfaces, a public browser/React SDK, a standalone
adapter demo, and a deterministic mock control plane. None of these surfaces
imports or starts Paperclip's server, UI, CLI, or production database.

## Public package surfaces

- `@paperclipai/paperclip-runner` — production contracts, clients/backends,
  PRP validation/replay, canonical catalog/dispatcher, and compatibility check.
- `@paperclipai/paperclip-runner/testing` — deterministic mocks plus PRP and
  semantic conformance kits. Tests and external conformance consumers import
  this explicitly.
- `@paperclipai/paperclip-runner/evals` — versioned native-attempt metadata,
  fail-closed package/binary compatibility checks, and explicit runnerd
  artifact resolution for eval consumers.

The package root has no mock or scenario exports. Generic credential-free
matrix orchestration lives in the workspace-private
`@paperclipai/paperclip-eval-kernel`; scenario content and provider-backed eval
campaigns remain outside the runtime package.
See [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-runner-testing-eval-package-boundaries.md).

The two conformance surfaces intentionally prove different contracts. The
existing `runControlPlanePortConformance` suite checks narrow PRP run/event
persistence. `CAPABILITY_HIGH_RISK_SEMANTIC_VECTORS` and
`runSemanticConformanceKit` compare normalized tool authorization, state,
effects, audit, retries, conflicts, redaction, continuation, and terminal
decisions. The production adapter stays App-owned and invokes Paperclip's real
route/service authorities; it does not copy those rules into this package.

## Quick start

The package also builds `paperclip-runner-acpx-sidecar`. This bounded v2
stdin/stdout bridge admits the pinned Claude and Codex ACPX profiles. It
validates the exact model, session identity, tool catalog, structured input,
and terminal settlement at the process boundary. Pi remains unavailable.

Runnerd selects only qualified provider profiles. Claude Managed and AWS
AgentCore receive immutable company-profile snapshots with explicit retention,
spend, and invocation limits. No provider process receives a Paperclip API
credential or unrestricted server environment.

Claude Managed resolves its API key from the company secret bound to the
selected profile. AWS AgentCore uses workload identity only; long-lived static
AWS access keys are intentionally removed from the runner environment.

The Rust core includes a bounded client for the sidecar protocol. It enforces
request identity, event order, frame and queue limits, timeouts, redacted
diagnostics, and process-group cleanup. Runnerd selects this package-local
transport only through an exact qualified provider descriptor.

Before a later provider adapter consumes a valid sidecar event, the Rust core
also requires its optional or mandatory run and turn scope to match the active
execution. Process and diagnostic events can remain global. All operational,
tool, input, permission, and terminal events require the exact active binding.

A package-local payload boundary decodes events only after that scope check. It
validates control identities, terminal status, question sets, and the admitted
runtime event types and bounded fields. It redacts diagnostic and retained
event values again before they can enter provider state.

Validated ACPX runtime events normalize into the same provider-neutral activity
families as the direct Codex transport. Reasoning contents stay private. Tool
targets are resolved within the workspace under the provider host's path
semantics and receive a versioned sidecar boundary marker before becoming
bounded, display-only PRP safe paths. Raw or unmarked provider locations fail
closed. URI-scheme and Windows drive-shaped values require a separate sidecar
attestation backed by an existing in-workspace entry or, for a not-yet-created
edit target, an existing in-workspace parent. This preserves real POSIX colon
filenames without treating arbitrary URI text as a path. Windows separators
are canonicalized, and consumers must not reinterpret the display value as
file-access authority. Operational semantic-result and terminal events remain
reserved for the stateful adapter rather than being duplicated.

The ACPX provider reducer preserves that order while it tracks one
active turn, bounded assistant text, semantic results, and pending tool or input
correlations. Terminal events flush the final assistant message first and clear
unresolved turn-scoped requests.

The package-local session bootstrap starts the bounded sidecar transport,
verifies the qualified capability handshake and effective model, opens one
identity-bound session, and confirms its run attachment. Any failed bootstrap
terminates the process; session shutdown preserves persistent provider state.
The session can then start one immutable-workspace turn, request interruption,
and reduce polled events through the scope-first state boundary. A mismatched
command acknowledgement or invalid event terminates the session fail closed.
Polled semantic calls pass through the run-scoped authorized tool bridge before
they can be returned to a caller. Before a follow-up turn releases settled tool
receipts, runner-core suspends and reaps the idle sidecar/provider generation,
then resumes the same verified persistent identity in a fresh generation. This
prevents a late session-lifetime MCP callback from inheriting the next turn's
event authority.

The Rust question-response validator checks the versioned response envelope
against the exact persisted question IDs, answer modes, options, required
answers, custom-answer policy, and text constraints before provider delivery.
Tool results and structured question responses then use two-phase resolution:
validate retained identity and schema, require the exact sidecar
acknowledgement, and only then clear pending local state. Codex permission
requests violate its pinned sidecar policy and terminate the session fail
closed.
Safe suspension is available only with no active turn or pending request. The
sidecar must return the exact persistent session identity before runnerd
terminates the local process.
Already validated ACPX reducer events project into provider-neutral durable
events only with an exact run, session, turn, and item binding. Raw sidecar
envelopes and permission requests are not admitted at this boundary.
A safely suspended session can be recorded as a bounded private checkpoint.
The checkpoint binds the exact provider identity, run, catalog revision, and
catalog digest and is replaced atomically before a later recovery attempt.
Recovery releases the stored identity only after those bindings match the
prospective session configuration exactly.

Run the complete contract gate with:

```sh
pnpm install --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner --lockfile=false --offline --ignore-scripts --dev
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner verify
```

The verification command requires a stable Rust toolchain with `cargo` on
`PATH`, in addition to Node.js 24.11+ and pnpm 9+.

Minimal Debian/Ubuntu hosts without root access can extract the required
Playwright browser libraries into a user-owned cache and run the same acceptance
sequence with:

```sh
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner verify:rootless
```

The tracer's final line is stable:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "paperclip.runner.conformance.output.v1",
  "runIdentity": {
    "runId": "run_conformance_0001",
    "sessionId": "session_conformance_0001"
  },
  "result": {
    "status": "succeeded",
    "summary": "Standalone Conformance fixture accepted."
  }
}
```

Run only the tracer with:

```sh
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner trace:conformance
```

Replay the Replay happy path, run a Local session, or open the browser
devtool:

```sh
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner replay:fixture
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner trace:local-runner -- --scenario happy-path
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner trace:codex
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner demo:live-console -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4174

# Live console: chat with a live session in the browser.
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner console:live-console
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner browser:dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4179

# SDK: open the public-SDK reference console and mini consumer.
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner console:sdk

# Standalone: run the standalone legacy/native/kill-switch tracer and page.
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner trace:standalone
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner trace:standalone -- --feature-flag enabled
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner trace:standalone -- --feature-flag enabled --kill-switch enabled
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner demo:standalone

```

Live console provider-backed routes are loopback-only and reject wildcard/LAN
binds. Browser mutations require same-origin Fetch Metadata, matching Origin,
and JSON content; see the protocol-server tutorial for direct `curl` examples.

## Direct live protocol qualification

The canonical direct live protocol suite lives in the separate
`paperclip-evals` repository under `evals/paperclip-runner/`. Its
`live-mini.json` roster is the complete 35-case Codex qualification lane. Build
this package's TypeScript output, release `paperclip-runnerd`, package tarball,
and `dist-issue-thread` viewer, then use the roster runner documented in that
repository. The package ships the required orchestration entry point as
`paperclip-runner-eval-session` (`dist/cli/eval-session.js`). Evalbook owns the
consistent HTML matrix and read-only attempt drill-down pages.

The hosted full-campaign workflow, parallel matrix, credential boundaries,
canonical report merge, and versioned S3 index are documented in
[`docs/runner-protocol-live-evals.md`](docs/runner-protocol-live-evals.md).

This direct protocol qualification is separate from the stress-derived Runner
workflow schedule below and from the full-stack browser model E2E suite.

## Stress-derived workflow, chaos, and AWS AgentCore operations

The deterministic workflow scorer and the chaos schedule do not require
provider credentials:

```sh
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner test:runner-workflow-evals
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner report:runner-chaos-evals
```

`report:runner-live-evals` is a paid, provider-backed command. Native Codex
requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`; ACPX Claude requires
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; OpenCode candidates require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. The live
matrix admits no Pi profile and does not persist credential values. Set
`PAPERCLIP_EVAL_MAX_CAMPAIGN_COST_USD` to a positive finite number to bound
additional scheduling after the observed campaign total reaches that value:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_EVAL_MAX_CAMPAIGN_COST_USD=12 \
  PAPERCLIP_EVALS_ROOT=/path/to/paperclip-evals \
  pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner report:runner-live-evals

# Run two scheduled native Codex executions only.
PAPERCLIP_EVALS_ROOT=/path/to/paperclip-evals \
  pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner report:runner-live-evals -- \
  --candidate codex-luna --limit 2
```

GitHub-hosted live campaigns additionally require the default branch, an
allowlisted numeric actor ID, the protected `runner-e2e-paid` environment, and
an explicit repository variable before scheduled runs are enabled. Manual
dispatches accept the same candidate, case, and execution-limit selectors. The
paid job uses the reviewed RunsOn Fleet label when `RUNNER_E2E_AWS_ENABLED=true`
and otherwise stays on `ubuntu-latest`. Uploaded reports contain redacted
observations and trace digests, not raw provider
frames, prompts, credentials, tool arguments, or hidden reasoning.

The AgentCore proof-of-concept uses an AWS CLI v2 profile to provision a
dedicated invocation role and scoped resources. Its local mode-`0600` metadata
file contains no access keys; probes assume short-lived STS credentials and
clear them after use. Validate locally, provision or inspect the stack, run the
bounded lab/smoke, and tear it down explicitly with:

```sh
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner test:aws-agentcore-provisioning
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner aws-agentcore:provision -- --dry-run
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner aws-agentcore:provision
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner aws-agentcore:probe
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner aws-agentcore:lab
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner smoke:capability:aws-agentcore
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner aws-agentcore:destroy -- --yes
```

To admit the hosted direct-eval workflow, provision with the account-local
GitHub Actions OIDC provider and keep the default exact repository and protected
environment binding:

```sh
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner aws-agentcore:provision -- \
  --aws-profile paperclip-dev \
  --github-oidc-provider-arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

This adds only `repo:paperclipai/paperclip:environment:runner-e2e-paid` as a
web-identity subject on the scoped invocation role. The generated nonsecret
profile records that role as both the local invocation role and the hosted
execution role.

Provisioning can incur Bedrock, AgentCore Runtime/Memory, storage, and private
networking charges. Provisioning refuses to modify a colliding stack unless its
Paperclip ownership tags and template description match. A verified
`ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` stack still requires `--replace-failed-stack` plus an
interactive confirmation (or `--yes`) before it can be deleted and recreated.
Destruction requires `--yes` and refuses to remove a stack with an active
recorded lab unless `--force` is also supplied.

Codex adds the package-local real-model reference driver, Live console adds the
package-local browser console, and SDK extracts a reusable public SDK plus
two standalone consumers. Runtime production Paperclip integration remains
deferred; the App-owned production conformance adapter is test-only.

The SDK reference console opens in direct chat mode. Enter a normal prompt,
then open the protocol inspector to review events and reducer state. Expand a
Terminal row and its nested **Debug details** disclosure to inspect every
canonical event retained for that command. The header marker `🖇️ v0.1.2`
identifies the current console iteration.
