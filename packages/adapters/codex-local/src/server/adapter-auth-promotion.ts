// The device-login credential promotion. It runs after a successful device

// export rules, then writes the credential into the company scope only.
//
// The helper never writes the instance-global host (`CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex`),
// because that source has no `companyId`. It writes two company-scoped targets:
// this account's own home, and — only as a fallback for an agent with no bound
// secret — the company default home.
//
// This account's own home is the durable result of a login: the write is fail
// loud, and the caller names it with a company secret so any agent can bind to
// it. The company default home write is best-effort — a failure there never
// fails the login — and is scoped by the shared decision predicate: it seeds an
// absent or unusable slot, refreshes a same-identity slot only with a
// strictly-newer credential, and keeps a slot a different account holds.
//
// Two decisions gate the write:
//   - Decision C: only a user-initiated login seeds a home. An automatic
//     background path never seeds one.
//   - Decision H: the helper writes only while the session still holds the sole
//     active claim on `(company_id, adapter_type)`. This is defense in depth over
//     the partial unique index, so a second session cannot race the same slot.
//
// The helper preserves company scope, private modes, atomic rename, the
// directory lock, and redacted logs. It never logs token bytes or a raw
// `account_id`.
