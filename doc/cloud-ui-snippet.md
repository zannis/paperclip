# Cloud UI snippet

Cloud operators can set `PAPERCLIP_CLOUD_UI_SNIPPET` to an HTML snippet.
The server inserts it before `</body>` in static and Vite-served UI pages.
It requires the existing Cloud-managed instance signal. Self-hosted instances
ignore this setting. No snippet is enabled by default.

This is trusted deployment configuration, not user input. It executes in the
application origin and is visible to every browser that receives the UI shell.
Do not include secrets or customer data. Restart the app after changing it.
Operators must review scripts and any required CSP changes before deployment.

## Base64 variant

Delivery pipelines that write env vars through provider APIs can sit behind
web application firewalls that reject values containing raw script markup.
`PAPERCLIP_CLOUD_UI_SNIPPET_B64` carries the same snippet through them as
standard base64 of the UTF-8 HTML:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_CLOUD_UI_SNIPPET_B64="$(base64 < snippet.html)"
```

Whitespace and line wrapping in the value are tolerated. A value that is not
canonical padded base64 of UTF-8 text, or that decodes to blank, is ignored —
if the widget does not appear, check that the value round-trips through
`base64 -d`. A present `PAPERCLIP_CLOUD_UI_SNIPPET` always wins, blank
included: clearing the plain variable to blank disables injection even while
a base64 value is still deployed. Everything else about the snippet is
unchanged.

Base64 does not defeat every firewall. Some decode the value before matching,
so they reject a base64 snippet whose decoded bytes still contain script
markup. Deliver a bare script body (below) through one of these.

## Bare script body

Set the value to the script body alone — the JavaScript with no surrounding
`<script>` element:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_CLOUD_UI_SNIPPET_B64="$(base64 < snippet.body.js)"
```

The server wraps a bare body in a `<script>` element before it inserts it. The
first non-whitespace character decides the form: a value that starts with `<`
is treated as markup and injected unchanged; any other value is treated as a
body and wrapped. This applies to both the plain and the base64 variant.

The body must be safe to embed inline. It must not contain a literal
`</script>`, which would close the wrapper early. Because the value carries no
`<script` marker, a firewall that decodes base64 before matching passes it.

## Plain closed beta

Set the value to this standard embed, replacing `YOUR_CHAT_APP_ID` with the
public chat app ID for the target environment:

```html
<script>
(function(d) {
  var script = d.createElement('script');
  script.src = 'https://chat.cdn-plain.com/index.js';
  script.onload = function() { Plain.init({ appId: 'YOUR_CHAT_APP_ID' }); };
  d.head.appendChild(script);
})(document);
</script>
```

No signing secret or Plain API key is required. No Paperclip customer identity
or organization data is passed. Plain manages the anonymous browser session;
there is no Paperclip account-switch integration. Ask users for identifying
information when needed. The existing feedback flag remains unchanged.

## Verification and rollback

On staging, open `/`, `/index.html`, and an organization dashboard directly.
Confirm the bubble appears and a test message reaches Plain. Verify the support
reply returns. On a self-hosted instance, confirm no snippet or widget is loaded.
Unset the snippet and restart to remove it on the next page load. Existing open
tabs retain the widget until refreshed. No production deployment is implied.
