# Run-Log Events

Run-log events write to the `heartbeat_run_events` table
(`packages/db/src/schema/heartbeat_run_events.ts:6-20`). They are not
Paperclip Telemetry events, and they are not OpenTelemetry exports. A run-log
event needs no operator endpoint.

## Native PRP Run-Log Events

The hidden native coordinator writes each validated PRP event to the bound
run's existing event stream before it acknowledges the runner. The row keeps
the PRP `eventType`, source instance, source event ID, source sequence, protocol
schema version, and a SHA-256 digest of the canonical source envelope. Its
payload is `{ "prpEvent": <canonical PRP event> }`.

PostgreSQL JSONB cannot represent NUL (U+0000), which can occur in command
output such as Vite virtual-module paths. The run-event payload column uses a
lossless storage codec for these events: the JSONB projection renders NUL as
the literal `\u0000`, and the reserved `$paperclipRunEventJsonV1` field contains
the original serialized JSON as a doubly escaped string. Ordinary payloads
retain their existing representation. Drizzle reads restore the exact original
payload before replay, hash validation, redaction, or API presentation. SQL
queries can still inspect ordinary routing fields in the projection; raw SQL
readers of the whole payload must apply `decodeRunEventPayload`. The column
remains JSONB and requires no schema migration.

The writer locks the native `heartbeat_runs` row and allocates the existing
per-run `seq` cursor. A byte-equivalent retry reuses the first row; a changed
retry or source-sequence gap is rejected. Company, issue, agent, run, session,
and runner-source bindings must match the persisted native run. Bootstrap
tickets, reconnect leases, authentication proofs, encryption keys, and raw
credential material are never written to the run log.

These records remain run-log events. They do not create an OpenTelemetry or
Paperclip Telemetry export, and legacy adapters do not use this writer.

## Native Restart Recovery Run-Log Event

Paperclip writes a `native.recovery.transition` event for every native restart
classification and for graceful restart suspension. This immutable run-log
record lets operators reconstruct recovery decisions without exporting data to
Paperclip Telemetry or OpenTelemetry.

The payload contains the restart kind, recovery request id when one exists,
runner disposition, and the controller generation and provider attempt for a
claimed recovery. Live-runner adoption also records the runner PID, process
group, and process-start fingerprint. A non-claim disposition records a bounded
reason instead. Graceful suspension records the signal and confirms that it did
not create a retry run.

The event never includes bootstrap tickets, reconnect leases, authentication
proofs, encryption keys, environment variables, provider credentials, command
arguments, or an unsanitized stderr stream. Detailed failed-attempt diagnostics
remain in the bounded `native_run_finalizations.recovery_history` ledger.

## Native Local Process Stop Evidence

The server writes `native.local_process_stopped` in the same transaction that
clears a local run's process identity, after it verifies that its PID and process
group are absent. The payload contains only those process IDs. Remote process
IDs are never checked against the control-plane host.

The server writes `native.process_start_requested` before a backend can spawn,
and `native.process_identity_recorded` when it stores a new native process
identity. Either invalidates an earlier local stop receipt, including a crash
before the new PID callback. Continuation admission accepts only the latest
server-authored event among these three types; provider
source events cannot supply stop authority. These records stay in the local run
log and do not add Telemetry or OpenTelemetry data.

## Verified Local Codex Replacement Evidence

The server writes `native.stopped_text_turn_verified` in the same transaction
that schedules a fresh successor for a stopped local Codex run. It records the
runner and provider process identities, retained-state digests, provider thread
and turn IDs, and IDs of exactly receipted task-completion calls. The server first
checks the complete turn inventory, process-stop receipt, and execution binding.
Unknown actions or changed retained state prevent this event and replacement.

The record documents why the old execution can be retired. It does not make the
old session resumable, rewrite provider files, or authorize replay on its own.
It remains in the local run log and adds no Telemetry or OpenTelemetry export.

## Sandbox Startup Run-Log Event

Paperclip writes one `run.startup.step` event to the run log for each bring-up
step. This event is a run-log record, not a first-party telemetry event. The
generated telemetry contract does not cover it, so this section is its canonical
contract.

The event payload carries only three fields.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `step` | string | The bring-up step name, for example `stage.sync`. |
| `durationMs` | number | The wall time of the step. A skipped step reports `0`. |
| `outcome` | string | The step outcome (`ok`, `skipped`, or `failed`). |

The event no longer carries the per-step round-trip count or the provider
duration fields. It dropped `roundTrips`, `providerExecMs`, `providerGetMs`,
`createRuntimeMs`, and `ensureSessionMs`. The startup spans in
[`doc/observability.md`](observability.md) carry that detail now. The
`sandbox.exec` child spans hold the round-trip and provider durations. The
`acp.handshake` step span holds the create-runtime and ensure-session
sub-times.

To read the detailed timing, use the startup spans. The spans need an OTLP
endpoint. A run with no endpoint keeps only the three run-log fields above.

## Run Phase Timing Run-Log Event

Paperclip writes one `run.phase.timing` event to the run log for each
run-lifecycle phase. This event is a run-log record, not a first-party telemetry
event. The generated telemetry contract does not cover it, so this section is its
canonical contract. The producer is `emitRunPhaseTiming` in
`packages/adapter-utils/src/acpx-engine/startup-timing.ts`.

The event payload carries only three fields.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `phase` | string | The run-lifecycle phase name from the closed allowlist below. |
| `durationMs` | number | The wall time of the phase. A negative or a non-finite value clamps to `0`. |
| `outcome` | string | The phase outcome (`ok` or `failed`). |

The `phase` field is one member of a closed, low-cardinality allowlist. The
producer drops any event whose phase name is outside this allowlist, so a
free-form label never reaches the run log. The allowlist has twelve phase names.

| Phase | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `place_workspace` | Place the run workspace. |
| `start_transport` | Start the agent transport. |
| `create_runtime` | Create the agent runtime. |
| `ensure_session` | Ensure the agent session exists. |
| `configure_session` | Configure the agent session. |
| `prepare_turn` | Prepare the turn. |
| `turn` | Run the turn. |
| `end_session` | End the agent session. |
| `settle_reuse` | Settle the session for reuse. |
| `stop_transport` | Stop the agent transport. |
| `sync_back` | Sync the workspace back. |
| `release_staging_lease` | Release the staging lease. |

The payload never carries a command, an argument, a path, an environment value,
or a raw identifier. The event rides the `ctx.onEvent` run-event bridge and is
run-log-only. It needs no OTLP endpoint.

## Related instrumentation

The sandbox duplex transport also writes one run-log event as one of its three
sinks. See the
[Sandbox Duplex Transport Instrumentation](observability.md#sandbox-duplex-transport-instrumentation)
section in the Observability contract.

## Execution recovery

Provider identity diagnostics remain in the local run log. They record the notification method, expected and received thread/turn identifiers, and the classification (root, verified descendant, stale, unrelated informational, or invalid authoritative). They omit the original provider payload and credentials. Repeated informational notices are bounded.

Recovery lifecycle events retain the original structured failure code, retry attempt, next retry time, and predecessor/successor identifiers. Durable status delivery uses an idempotency marker; delivery grants no provider authority. Failed publication is retried without repeating provider work. These records are not first-party Telemetry.

Bounded retry exhaustion writes one lifecycle receipt per run, retry reason,
scheduled attempt, and retry limit. Repeated or concurrent recovery checks reuse
that receipt, including receipts from earlier builds, without advancing the event
sequence or publishing another live event. Attention reads select the latest
matching receipt in PostgreSQL and project only the run's issue/task identifiers
from its context, so historical duplicate receipts cannot multiply run contexts
in server memory. Existing duplicate events do not require deletion or migration.

### Workspace restore failures

Legacy adapter results can carry `workspaceRestoreFailure` with the code
`restore_permission_denied`, `restore_lock_timeout`, `restore_unsafe_archive`,
or `restore_failed`. The heartbeat records `workspace_restore_failed` and keeps
the run failed and the workspace-finalization barrier closed. Available output,
usage, session metadata, and the previous execution outcome survive settlement.
`executionBeforeRestore` retains the earlier error code, exit code, signal, and
timeout flag. The ordinary redacted error field retains an earlier error message.

The chat reports the restore phase separately from a missing final response.
A saved-plan link requires a stored document and its run-bound revision or a
matching run-bound review record. Older unclassified failures use neutral wording. Diagnostics show only
a validated relative member path, never an archive link target or host path.

An unsafe archive or an outbound confinement refusal keeps the existing execution recovery hold, including across
conversation resets. It cannot start another model turn until an operator uses
the existing recovery action to record `executionReconciliation` with
`workspaceRepairEvidence` (20–12000 characters). This evidence must describe
verified safe staging or repair for the referenced failed run. It does not grant
plan approval. Saved comments, document revisions, and confirmation IDs and
states stay unchanged. Recovery uses the existing delivery identity and links
the successor to the original failed run. Repair does not reset the automatic
retry budget. Transient failures retain the existing
bounded retry policy. Archive confinement remains required.

Sandbox restore tasks also write a `Workspace restore diagnostic` line to the
run log on failure. `phase` is `workspace` or `asset`, so a failed staged-asset
copy-back (such as credentials) can be distinguished from workspace restoration. The line
contains only an allowlisted OS/transport `errorCode` (otherwise `unknown`), an
optional numeric HTTP error status, and an optional bounded process exit code.
Up to four nested causes are inspected. Messages, URLs, filesystem paths, asset
names, credentials, and response bodies are excluded. Every failed outbound
task emits its own diagnostic; nested repository failures are logged once by
the enclosing workspace task. The original error and restore safety policy are
unchanged. These lines stay in the instance run log and its configured durable
storage, and are not new first-party telemetry events.

## Codex resume usage snapshot

The native runner retains a bounded local `harness.diagnostic` event with code
`codex_resume_usage_snapshot`. It identifies `thread/tokenUsage/updated` as
`resume_usage_snapshot`, retains the reported thread and completed-turn IDs,
and records cumulative usage counters. It does not include provider credentials
or message content. The event establishes the accounting baseline; it is not a
new billable usage receipt or a user-facing provider warning. Other provider
identity checks remain in force.

## AI subscription contention

A fresh task execution cannot enter this wait. A run that already entered this
wait writes an informational `lifecycle` event to the local run log. Its
payload contains only `retryScheduled`, a boolean that reports
whether the scheduler created a retry.
The message distinguishes an automatic retry from work that is no longer eligible.
This pre-provider wait records `ai_connection_busy` on the cancelled run and does
not consume the provider-failure retry allowance. The event contains no credentials
and creates no Telemetry or OpenTelemetry export.
