# Cloud image variant (build with `--target cloud`): the production image
# plus built bundled sandbox-provider plugins. Managed instances receive a
# `plugins.autoInstall` key list through PAPERCLIP_MANAGED_CONFIG and
# install those plugins from the bundled catalog at boot
# (server/src/services/bundled-plugins.ts), which requires each plugin's
# dist/ to exist in the image — the default image ships only their source,
# so auto-install logs "bundle not present" and skips. The plugins are
# built in this separate target so the default (self-hosted) image stays
# lean; CI pins the default build to `--target production`, which is
# byte-identical to before this stage existed.
#
# The sandbox providers are intentionally excluded from the pnpm workspace
# (see pnpm-workspace.yaml), so each installs standalone exactly as its
# README prescribes. Installing in a `build`-based stage (not `production`)
# keeps devDependencies available for tsc: `production` sets
# NODE_ENV=production, which would make pnpm skip them.
#
# CLOUD_BUNDLED_PLUGINS is the space-separated list of sandbox-provider
# directory names to build into the variant. Only what managed deployments
# actually auto-install belongs here — every entry adds its node_modules
# to the image. Growing the list is a one-line workflow change.
