# Cloud image variant (build with `--target cloud`): the production image
# plus built bundled sandbox-provider plugins. Managed instances receive a
# `plugins.autoInstall` key list through PAPERCLIP_MANAGED_CONFIG and
# install those plugins from the bundled catalog at boot
# (server/src/services/bundled-plugins.ts), which requires each plugin's
# dist/ to exist in the image — the default image ships only their source,
# so auto-install logs "bundle not present" and skips. The plugins are
# built in this separate target so the default (self-hosted) image stays
# lean; CI pins the default build to `--target production`, which is
# byte-identical to before this stage existed.
#
# The sandbox providers are intentionally excluded from the pnpm workspace
# (see pnpm-workspace.yaml), so each installs standalone exactly as its
# README prescribes. Installing in a `build`-based stage (not `production`)
# keeps devDependencies available for tsc: `production` sets
# NODE_ENV=production, which would make pnpm skip them.
#
# CLOUD_BUNDLED_PLUGINS is the space-separated list of sandbox-provider
# directory names to build into the variant. Only what managed deployments
# actually auto-install belongs here — every entry adds its node_modules
# to the image. Growing the list is a one-line workflow change.

# The hosted image variant ships selected optional peer packages
# pre-installed. A managed tenant then needs no separate install step.
# The self-hosted image stays on the opt-in contract: it never runs this
# stage, so a package like `@sentry/node` stays a true optional peer
# dependency. A self-hosted operator installs it by hand (see
# doc/observability.md).
#
# CLOUD_BUNDLED_SERVER_DEPS names the optional peer packages to install.
# The value is a space-separated list, the same shape as
# CLOUD_BUNDLED_PLUGINS above. The stage reads each package's version
# from the `peerDependencies` block of `server/package.json` at build
# time, so the version has one committed home.
#
# The stage fails the build in three cases:
# - the argument is empty
# - server/package.json declares no version for a named package
# - the named package is not an optional peer
#
# This check keeps the argument limited to packages the server already
# treats as optional.
#
# The install happens in its own isolated directory, not inside
# `server`'s own workspace install. The self-hosted target above never
# gains these packages this way. The directory sits under `/app`, not
# `server/`, and `--ignore-workspace` below excludes it from the pnpm
# workspace. From that directory, pnpm still finds the `packageManager`
# pin in the repo's own `package.json` by walking up — the same pnpm
# version the rest of the build uses.
#
# The install writes no lock file (`--no-lockfile`, the same flag the
# `cloud-plugins` stage above uses). Two builds of the same commit can
# therefore install different transitive versions of a named package.
# Three facts make this an accepted trade-off:
# - the `cloud-plugins` stage above already has the same property, with
#   the same flag
# - the direct version of each named package comes from one exact,
#   single-sourced place: the `peerDependencies` block of
#   `server/package.json`
# - an automated check asserts the installed direct version after every
#   build, so a transitive drift that breaks the package still fails the
#   build
