/**
 * Backend-free walkthrough of the connect step's sign-in, deployed so the flow
 * can be reviewed from a link rather than a checkout.
 *
 * The sibling of `connect-model-preview-main.tsx`, and the difference between
 * them is the point of this one. That page renders `ConnectModelPreview`, a
 * mock built to ask a question about the tile row. This one imports the
 * *shipped* login card, rows and field from `components/AdapterLoginChrome` —
 * the same components the wizard renders — so what is on screen is the
 * implementation rather than a drawing of it. The step's furniture around them
 * (stepper, avatar, heading, tiles, credential link, footer) is the real
 * presentational set too.
 *
 * What is faked is only the server. The three delays below stand in for a
 * session start, a prompt round trip, and the poll that lands while the
 * customer is finishing a login somewhere else. The wizard itself is not here:
 * it needs a query client, a router and a company.
