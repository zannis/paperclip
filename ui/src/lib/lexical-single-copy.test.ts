/**
 * Lexical must resolve to exactly one copy across the app and the rich editor.
 *
 * The editor registers the app's own nodes (mention-aware links, paste
 * handling) into MDXEditor's Lexical instance. If the app and MDXEditor load
 * different copies — or different versions of the same package — Lexical's
 * `LexicalBuilder` invariant throws during render, the editor falls back to
 * its raw-source textarea, and every markdown field in the product silently
 * degrades.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: root `pnpm.overrides` once force-pinned the
 * Lexical family past the range `@mdxeditor/editor` supports, while leaving
 * `@lexical/extension` (absent from the override list) on the older line. The
 * mismatch shipped and broke the editor everywhere. These assertions fail
 * fast on the resolution graph instead of waiting for a render crash.
