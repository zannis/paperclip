 * is being redesigned here.
 *
 * `onboarding` is the connect step's card. The difference is not skin-deep: the
 * step's own footer button starts the login, so the panel has no "Sign in"
 * control of its own, and success is not something the card reports — the step
 * moves on. What is left is the part the customer acts on, which is the
