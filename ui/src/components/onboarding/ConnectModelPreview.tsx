/**
 * A prototype of the connect step, from the PCLP-Onboarding file (nodes
 * 2941:8291 and 2933:4592).
 *
 * A mock, not the shipped step. The wizard's real step 4 puts two adapter cards
 * over an advanced-settings disclosure and probes the environment before
 * hiring; none of that is wired up here. What is here is the part the design is
 * actually asking a question about — how the row of sources reads as you point
 * at it, pick one, and flip the whole row between subscription and API
 * credentials — so it can be judged before any of that machinery is moved.
 *
 * It lives in `components/` rather than beside a story because two surfaces
 * render it: the Storybook stories, and the standalone
 * `connect-model-preview.html` entry that gets deployed for review. A copy in
 * each would have drifted the moment one was tweaked.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches a backend, and it needs none of the app's providers —
 * every piece it composes is presentational.
 */

/**
 * The two sources the step offers, matching the shipped step's own list.
 *
 * Claude Code and Codex are the only adapters the display registry marks
 * `recommended`, and the real step builds its row from exactly that filter — so
 * a third tile here would be a design the wizard could never render. OpenCode
 * was drawn at one point and is deliberately gone.
