 * and consumed by an effect that calls `setStep`, and every defect this file
 * guards lived in that seam rather than in either side of it — the pure
 * helpers in `onboarding-route.test.ts` passed while the wizard was moving a
 * customer off the step they were typing on. So the real component is rendered
 * here, with the real route resolver and the real mission hook, and only the
 * network and the surrounding contexts are stubbed.
