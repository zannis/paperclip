 * The onboarding wizard's agent arc: create the agent, connect a model, review.

 * organization is named in Cloud before they arrive, which is why the strip
 * counts to three rather than to the wizard's own step numbers.
 *
 * The step stories below mount the real wizard against the Storybook API
 * fixtures. That matters more here than in most stories: these screens only
 * render for a signed-in account that owns a provisioned stack, so before this
 * existed the only way to see them was to walk a real signup — and when the
 * connect step failed on a live stack, the review step behind it could not be

/**
 * Seeds the draft the wizard restores from, opens it at the arc's first step,
 * and takes the draft back out again on the way past.
 *
 * Three details the wizard's own design forces:
 *
 * The draft is written during render, not in an effect. Roughly twenty
 * `useState(saved?.x ?? default)` initializers read the restored blob exactly
 * once, on first render, so a draft written after mount arrives too late to
 * matter.
 *
 * `createdCompanyId` has to be a company the fixtures report as owned.
 * `restoreOnboardingState` treats restoring as an authorization decision and
 * discards the whole blob when the saved company is not in the list — correctly,
 * since localStorage is per-origin and would otherwise hand one account's draft
 * to another.
 *
 * Every story enters here, at step 3, and the later ones walk forward. Opening
 * directly on a later step is the obvious shortcut and it is wrong: `entryStep`
 * is captured once at mount from exactly this draft, `initialStep` sets both it
 * and the current step together, and Back is offered only while
 * `currentStep > entryStep`. A story opened on step 4 is a step 4 that can never
 * show its Back button — which is not a preview of the step, it is a preview of
 * a state no customer is ever in.
 *
 * And the cleanup is not housekeeping. That same per-origin storage is shared
 * with every other story in the session: a draft left behind makes the next
 * story restore a saved step ahead of the one it asked for, so the reviewer
 * lands on a screen they did not click on and reads it as a wizard bug.

 * mount point and times out.
 *
 * Waiting for `toBeEnabled` is not defensive padding. Connect stays disabled
 * through `adapterEnvLoading` and `missionUnresolvedForHire`, both of which
 * resolve from queries, so clicking on first paint clicks a dead button and the
 * story silently stops one step short of where it says it is.

 * from the wait above. The wizard re-renders as those queries land, and a node
 * captured a moment earlier can be detached by the time it is clicked — a click
 * that raises no error and does nothing.
 *
 * The arrival is waited on by *heading*, not by the next button's label. The arc
 * labels its forward button "Next" on every step it has one, so a story that
 * waited for a button name would be satisfied by the button it just clicked and
 * report arriving somewhere it never left. This is not hypothetical: these
 * stories waited for a button named "Connect" until the label changed, at which
