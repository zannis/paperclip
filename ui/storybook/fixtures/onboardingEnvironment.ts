/**
 * The environment and auth state the connect step reads, as something a story
 * can choose.
 *
 * The step's provider sign-in panel is gated on four separate things — the
 * adapter declaring a login capability, a *sandbox* environment resolving, that
 * environment's provider supporting a login PTY, and the auth signal coming back
 * absent. Miss any one and the panel silently does not render, which looks
 * exactly like it having been deleted.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: the first version of these fixtures returned an
 * empty environment list, and the sign-in panel was invisible in every story
 * because of it. So the states are named here and selected per story rather than
 * left implicit in a single hard-coded response.
