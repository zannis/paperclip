/**
 * Builds the standalone connect-flow preview (`connect-flow-preview.html`) on its
 * own, for deploying as a static page that a reviewer can open from a link.
 *
 * A separate config rather than a second rollup input on the app's build, and
 * the reason is what ends up on the host rather than tidiness: a shared build
 * emits the app's ~6MB `main` chunk into the same `dist/assets`, and every file
 * in the deployed directory is publicly fetchable whether or not anything links
 * to it. Building alone means the deployed bundle is this screen and the pieces
 * it composes, full stop. It also leaves the app's own build untouched.
 *
 *   cd ui && npx vite build --config vite.flow-preview.config.mjs
 *
 * Invoked directly rather than through a `build:flow-preview` script, and the
 * reason is governance rather than taste: CODEOWNERS owns `package.json` by
 * bare name, which matches at any depth, so adding one line to `ui/package.json`
 * puts a preview-only convenience behind a code-owner review. The command is
 * the same either way.

 * Renamed on disk in `closeBundle` rather than rekeyed in `generateBundle`:
 * Vite's own HTML plugin emits the document after user plugins have had their
 * `generateBundle` turn, so a bundle-level rename finds nothing to rename. The
 * document's asset links are absolute (`/assets/...`), so moving the file
 * itself breaks nothing.
